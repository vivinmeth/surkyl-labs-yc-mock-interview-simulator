## Updating Questions & Tips

The application uses a YAML file for easy data management. To add or modify questions:

1. Open `src/assets/data/data.yml`
2. Add questions under the `questions:` section
3. Add tips under the `tips:` section

Example:
```yaml
questions:
  - What are you working on?
  - How will you make money?
  # Add more questions here...

tips:
  - Try to have quick and concise answers.
  - Know your numbers cold.
  # Add more tips here...
```

No JavaScript knowledge required - just edit the YAML file and refresh!
